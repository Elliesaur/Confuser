# Confuser
Confuser 1.9 Mod. Dynamic methods used in constant and control flow.

A few other tricks have been added to prevent debugging/decompilation.

This project was made more than a year ago over a few days for fun.

Don't use it as a serious means of obfuscation, not to mention Confuser is a retired project.
